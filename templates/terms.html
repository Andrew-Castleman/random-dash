      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <p><em>Last updated: February 2025</em></p>

      <h3>1. Acceptance</h3>
      <p>By using Apartment Deals (“the site”), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the site.</p>

      <h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
      <p>Apartment Deals is a free tool that aggregates and displays apartment listings for the San Francisco and Stanford-area rental markets. We show deal scores based on publicly available data and market estimates. Listings and details (including links) come from third-party sources; we do not create or verify those listings.</p>

      <h3>3. No Warranty</h3>
      <p>The site and all content are provided “as is.” We do not guarantee accuracy, completeness, or availability of any listing or market data. You use the site at your own risk. Always verify listing details, pricing, and availability with the actual listing source (e.g. Craigslist or the landlord) before making any decision.</p>

      <h3>4. Third-Party Links and Content</h3>
      <p>We link to external sites (e.g. Craigslist) for listing details. We are not responsible for their content, privacy practices, or terms. Your use of third-party sites is subject to their policies.</p>

      <h3>5. Acceptable Use</h3>
      <p>You may not use the site to violate any law, scrape or overload our systems without permission, or attempt to interfere with the site’s operation. We may restrict or terminate access if we believe you have violated these terms.</p>

      <h3>6. Intellectual Property</h3>
      <p>The site’s design, text, and code (excluding third-party content and listings) are owned by us or our licensors. Listing content and images remain the property of the respective listing sources.</p>

      <h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the site or reliance on any information provided here.</p>

      <h3>8. Changes</h3>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the site after changes constitutes acceptance. The “Last updated” date indicates the latest version.</p>
